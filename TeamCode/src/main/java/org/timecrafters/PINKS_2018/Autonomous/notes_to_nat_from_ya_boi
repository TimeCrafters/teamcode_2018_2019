1. Numbers do not belong in java naming convention this isn't 1998
    https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-135099.html
2. States should only contains basic operations i.e drive and then have constructors which
    determine what the operations outcome is ie how far and how fast.
3. Use sub engines to make assessments on which path you should be going to i.e block is at
    index 0 so this sub engine is active.
4. If you are using the word step in a state then it is no longer a basic operation and
    should be offloaded to a sub engine process. If everything is a step then just remove
    the word step from the file name, it is implied that it is a step.
5. What is the point of comment blocks if they are all going to be the same?
6. If you are abbreviating a long word or sentence re-think why you are naming it that way.
